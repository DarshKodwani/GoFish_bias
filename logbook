1) Need to compute the parameter dependence of the SSC and Gaussian. 
- For gaussian, can create an array cov_gauss_p and cov_gauss_m to compute the derivative of the parameters. 
2) Need to create dicov analogous to dcl_arr
3) To do that basically need to do the following:
- create cosmop and cosmom with cosmology parameters plus and minus
- Compute inverse_cov using them, i.e  covp = inv_cov(cosmop,False)
- Then write the trace part for SSC
